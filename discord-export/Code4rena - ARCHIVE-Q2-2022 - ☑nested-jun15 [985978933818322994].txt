any other gas optimizations other than mentioned here are valid right?

Hi @axxe,
I have a question regarding the various operators.
For example, if I take the BeefyVault contract. I can see that we call the `deposit` function to deposit in the Beefy vault: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/b253ed80f67d1bb2a04e1702f5796fd96a7c521e/contracts/operators/Beefy/BeefyVaultOperator.sol#L49
In exchange, the BeefyVaultOperator contract receives tokens representing the shares of deposit in the vault.
So now, these tokens are living in the BeefyVaultOperator but when are they sent to the Reserve? Does this happen in the NestedFactory contract? Or does these tokens stay in the BeefyVaultOperator contract?

Hey all, I just thought I'd inform you about something you can do when you post links. In order to reduce the amount screen "real estate" taken up you can hover over the images and click on the little X and then click on "Remove All Embeds".

thankyou

Hey ! The operators are called via delegatecall by the NestedFactory. So the NestedFactory receive the tokens and send them to the reserve
